Title: SmartThings Virtual Switch

One of the more powerful options in the SmartThings platform is the ability to write your own device types which can then partipate in the automation rules and be queried/triggered by other Smart Apps.

It's not that many of us are going to design and build a Z-wave sensor or something, but it can be the case that you might implement some gagdet using Arduino, or want to incorporate some piece of tech with a RESTful API, and you can do these things by writing a Device Handler to integrate it with SmartThings.

At its most basic, though, you can write and implement a virtual switch. I don't know why SmartThings doesn't just ship one out of the box, since it's a perennially useful abstraction to have in an automation platform. Physical switches are fun, too, but they almost always perform some task in the physical world, like turning on a light or powering a relay or something. You know what switches do.

But a *virtual* switch, on the other hand, is a handy abstraction that doesn't have to do anything more than give you a target to tap. There are lots of "virtual switches" in the platform: your presence status is a virtual switch (you're either "Home" (on) or "Away" (off), for instance.

Maybe, for practice, you want to build a Smart App that's functionally equivalent to the [useless machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Useless_machine) that, when turned on, turns itself back off. Maybe you want to fire up your phone and have a button to press to do something, or you need a hook for another service like IFTTT to do the same thing. Maybe you use someone else's Smart App but they coded it to work on a physical switch and you have no such interest. I'm not here to judge or ask for acceptance, I just want one or more virtual switches so I can make things happen.
